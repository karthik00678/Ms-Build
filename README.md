  - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/plans/ai](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/plans/ai)
  - [aka.ms/learnatbuild](https://aka.ms/learnatbuild)
  - [aka.ms/AskLearnInVscode](https://aka.ms/AskLearnInVscode)
- **JetBrains:** Discussed Jetbrains IDE / ReSharper usage and best practices for .NET development and also why resharper always crashes visual studio
- **Opsera:** Offers a developer dashboard for Copilot usage and developer productivity metrics, similar to Neudesic‚Äôs dev productivity dashboard approach.
- **Docker:** Support for AI-intensive workloads in docker. Developers now spend less time on environment setup.
- **Visual Studio:** Announced IDE upgrades to support new Agent mode, though model rollout may take longer. Most developers are leaning towards VS Code C# extensions for .NET programming and also why resharper always crashes - (they had no answer for this üòâ)

## Sessions & Labs Attended

- **Dapr and Azure Service Bus:**  
  Dapr uses a sidecar architecture for microservices, simplifying distributed app development with consistent APIs for service invocation, state management, and event handling. Dapr is platform-agnostic and can be deployed on Kubernetes, cloud, or on-prem, offering flexible, portable solutions for distributed systems.  
  _The Dapr project was born at Microsoft but donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation as part of an incubation project._

- **AI Foundry Local and Aspire:**  
  Explored the benefits and challenges of running generative AI models locally versus in the cloud. Local processing offers cost savings and privacy but brings hardware and deployment challenges. Foundry Local helps optimize model delivery for diverse devices, but the session highlighted the real-world complexity and technical hurdles of managing local AI at scale. Waiting for more on this.

- **Semantic search and vector embeddings in SQL Server and Copilot in SSMS:**  
  SQL Server 2025 now supports vector data types and vector indexes, so we can store embeddings directly in tables and run similarity searches using T-SQL. This opens up RAG-style workflows and lets us combine vector search with full-text and semantic search inside the database. During the demo, they showed how you can translate content in a database (e.g., Chinese to English) using built-in AI features‚Äîworked well for multi-language scenarios. (Mostly in preview)

- **.NET Aspire lab for API orchestration:**  
  Walked through building distributed/cloud-native apps with .NET Aspire. Focused on how Aspire tries to improve developer productivity: config and setup are now simpler, and Aspire gives you sensible defaults. The new `ServiceDefaults` method lets you set up logging and telemetry for all your services in one go (no more repeating yourself). Aspire separates the overall app host from the individual services, making it easier to manage and compose multiple pieces. Orchestration tools help you wire up, monitor, and manage everything from one place, without a bunch of boilerplate.Overall, it felt a lot easier to wire up and orchestrate multi-service apps and monitor the app metrics with a nice dashboard.

- **Semantic search in PostgreSQL:**  
  PostgreSQL is getting new semantic operators that let you run similarity searches, vector queries, and use GenAI stuff right from SQL‚Äîno more relying on extensions or jumping out to Python. The session also showed a new VS Code extension where you can query the database from Copilot chat, and it actually gives you live query metrics, execution plans, and feedback in the chat window. Pretty useful for exploring data and understanding what‚Äôs going on with your queries, especially when experimenting with AI or RAG-style workloads.

- **Multi-agent systems ‚Äì Great Session**
  - Microsoft‚Äôs Agent Service, introduced last year at Ignite, is now GA in AI Foundry. It reminded me a lot of our Nexus project at Neudesic.
  - Most of the session was demos and discussion of agentic scenarios and use cases using the AI Foundry Agent Service. You can connect agents together as ‚Äútools‚Äù (A2A, agent-to-agent), and set up declarative workflows with Semantic Kernel.
  - Workflows are declared in code (using .fdl workflow controls), then deployed to Foundry, and you get an endpoint for interaction‚Äîeither via API or directly from the VS Code AI Foundry chat extension.
  - In Semantic Kernel, you can instantiate new agents and create multiple clients (for example, a student and teacher agent using client.createAssistantAsync). Conversations between agents use an event model.
  - Agents are ephemeral: you can create, delete, and update them on demand. Token exhaustion can be a problem for long workflows, so retry logic is important.  
  - You can connect with external agents (including ones built by other companies) using the new A2A protocol created by google.o	Workflows can generate structured outputs (JSON, not just text), and you can use MCP servers and plugins in the SK client setup.
  -	When agents fail because there are too many tools, the best approach is to put plugin/tool metadata into a vector store, then use semantic search so agents can select the right tool at runtime.
  -	The new ‚ÄúMagnetic One‚Äù framework adds a task ledger‚Äîif an agent fails, it can retry with a new strategy, so you get more resilience and creativity from the system.
  -	Microsoft is pushing both AutoGen and Semantic Kernel for multi-agent frameworks. Orchestration patterns from AutoGen are now usable in SK, which is now considered production-ready.
  -	Big idea: you can now build and connect A2A agents in Azure AI Foundry, hook them up with Semantic Kernel, and use open-sourced workflow patterns to build complex, multi-agent systems.

- **Blazor UI improvements and .NET 10:**  
  Covered updates in ASP.NET Core and Blazor, with .NET 10 aiming for better developer productivity and performance. There‚Äôs new scaffolding for both ASP.NET and Blazor, which speeds up project setup. The Kestrel web server in .NET 10 now uses 50% less CPU, which should help with hosting costs and hardware load. AI integration is easier, and a lot of big Microsoft web services are already running these updates. .NET has increased support for agents and AI extensions are coming, with quick agent setup via Semantic Kernel.

- **Ethical Hacking Lab for AKS:**  
  Kubernetes security lab focused on monitoring and defending against threats in AKS clusters and nodes. We practiced detecting attacks and suspicious activity, then used Azure‚Äôs security tools to investigate and respond. The hands-on lab followed real-world attack/defense scenarios‚Äîgood practical look at AKS security posture and controls.

- **Code, Create, Accelerate: Hands-on journey through NVIDIA‚Äôs full stack BYOD:**  
  This lab used NVIDIA NIM to build agentic workflows. We worked in Azure Kubernetes Service, used Azure Cloud Shell to access containers with NIM, and asked questions directly against the running agent. Showed how NVIDIA‚Äôs platform connects model training, scalable inference, and agent deployment on their GPUs.

- **Closing KeyNote:**  
  Scott Hanselman and Mark Russinovich kicked off the closing ‚ÄúLock Note‚Äù by emphasizing community engagement. The session highlighted practical robotics‚Äîusing an open-source Hello Robot to try to solve real-world tasks like fetching drinks. They demoed the robot live, showing object recognition, navigation, and voice command, but the robot struggled and failed a few times (was buggy, needed lots of recalibration). There was a discussion on the integration of AI models with robotics, and the reality that even with advanced models, there are real limits to what they can do reliably in physical environments.

## Hackathon

- **Copilot Studio and AI Foundry:**  
  Completed the Copilot Studio hackathon challenge (despite a lot of bugs‚ÄîMicrosoft acknowledged this). The task was to connect an OpenAPI pizza service via a Copilot agent/MCP and create a pizza order. When I finished, I got a raffle ticket for an Xbox, but no luck this time. Still, it was a fun and practical exercise.  
  I also partially completed the AI Foundry task by building a similar workflow, using Semantic Kernel and the agent SDK in Visual Studio.
